## My process


### Built with

HTML, SCSS and Javascript

### What I learned

I learned a lot about select elements and how hard the native select element is to style. I did not want to give up the built-in accessibility features of select elements, so I ended up with a hybrid solution that uses a custom-built select-like menu that is manipulated with the mouse and styled to match the page, as well as still having a native select element that can be accessed via keystrokes.
